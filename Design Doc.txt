The theme for our match four game is just a basic match the shapes, its very minimalistic in design.
The system works by using lists to hold the different objects like when flipping the pieces and even
with the animation for killing the pieces. the game gets randomized by creating a random seed
from a line of characters. the way the difficulty works is where the higher the difficulty the less
time you have to match the pieces to get the points required which the points required are randomized
in every game and the harder the difficulty the less points you will get for each match so you will
have to be smart with each match you make as well as faster. There are no bonus objects for this 
game but to make it interesting instead of just making the objects disappear they pop off the screen
to give it a cool effect.
